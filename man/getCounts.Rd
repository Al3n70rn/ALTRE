\title{Generates count data for regulatory regions}
\usage{
getCounts(annotpeaks, sampleinfo, reference, singleEnd = TRUE, chrom = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotpeaks}{list output from combineannotatepeaks function}

\item{sampleinfo}{dataframe as returned from loadCSVFile() function}

\item{reference}{name of sample type to be
considered 'reference' in DESeq2 analysis}

\item{singleEnd}{whether input data is single-end (default is TRUE)}

\item{chrom}{optional, only chromosome chrom will be evaluated}
}
\value{
List containing three items:
(1) DESeqDataSet: contains count information for all replicates of all samples
(2) Matrix: contains number of TSS-distal and TSS-proximal
 before and after filtering (if applicable)
(3) Data frame for creating a density plot (use function plotGetCounts()
}
\description{
Counts the number of reads in each regulatory region for each sample type --
read count is derived from user-input BAM filex, and regions of interest
are supplied in a Granges object, ideally output of combineannotatepeaks.R.
}
