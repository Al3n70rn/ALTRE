\title{Given a GRangeslist object with peaks for each samples, determine the consensus peaks (found in at least N replicates, where N is input by the user) for each sample type}
\usage{
getConsensusPeaks(samplepeaks, minreps)
}
\arguments{
\item{samplepeaks}{A GRangesList object comprising one GRanges object (peaks) for each sample (output of loadPeaks() function)}

\item{minreps}{minimum number of replicate samples that a peak should be contained in to be called as a consensus peak. This cutoff will be applied to both samples.}
}
\value{
a list comprising:
	1) a GRangeslist with one GRange for each sample type which contains consensus peaks
2) a summary statistic table
}
\description{
Given a GRangeslist object with peaks for each samples, determine the consensus peaks (found in at least N replicates, where N is input by the user) for each sample type
