\item{lfctypespecific}{log2fold change for type specific enhancers/promoters}

\item{lfcshared}{log2fold chance for shared enhancers/promoters}

\item{pvaltypespecific}{p-value for type specific enhancers/promoters}

\item{pvalshared}{p-value for shared enhancers/promoters}

\item{genes}{minimum number of genes allowable in a pathway}

\item{offspring}{maximum number of offspring allowable in a pathway}

\value{
dataframe identifying p-values for enriched pathways -- pathways also annotated with additional information
}
\description{
Determine which pathways are overrepresented in the
altered promoters and enhancers. Pathways are determined by linking
the enhancer/promoter to the nearest gene, and then linking genes to pathways using
the gene ontology database. The "gene" argument limits how few genes a pathway can contain,
while the "offspring" argument limits how many offspring a pathway can contain.
Pathways with low gene counts are less reliable (often false positives), while pathways
with many offspring are vague and unlikely to be of much use -- the enrichment of
their more precise offspring is the more interesting question.
