Title: Workflow: Post-alignment to altered enhancers
    and promoters
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Elizabeth Baskin, Rick Farouni, Ewy Mathe

Description: This workflow takes alignment data and hotspot calls from
    assays of open chromatin (ATAC-seq, Dnase-seq, and FAIRE-seq) and identifies
    regions (enhancers and promoters) that differ based on cell and
    tissue type.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
