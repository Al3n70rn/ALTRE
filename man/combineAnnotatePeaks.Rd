\title{Combine and annotate peaks from different sample types. Optionally merge nearby regions.}
\usage{
combineAnnotatePeaks(conspeaks, TSS, merge = FALSE, mergedistenh = 0,
  mergedistprom = 0, mergedist = 0, regionspecific = NA,
  distancefromTSS = 1500)
}
\arguments{
\item{conspeaks}{list of GRanges objects for each sample type (output by getConsensusPeaks() function)}

\item{TSS}{file of transcription start sites}

\item{merge}{whether or not regions should be merged if they are within a user set distance to each other (default is FALSE)}

\item{mergedistenh}{merge enhancers peaks if they are < mergedistenh apart (set when regionspecific is TRUE)}

\item{mergedistprom}{merge promoters if they are < mergedistprom apart (set when regionspecific is TRUE)}

\item{mergedist}{merge promoters and enhancers if they are < mergedist apart (set when regionspecific is FALSE)}

\item{regionspecific}{logical to if TRUE, merging occurs within same type peaks (e.g. merge promoters, then merge enhancers)}

\item{distancefromTSS}{in bp; peaks within distFromTSS of an annotated Transcription Start Site (TSS) will be annotated as a promoter (default=1500bp)}
}
\value{
List containing two items:
(1) GRanges object:  all sample types combined, regions annotated as type-specific
and enhancer/promoter specific.
(2) Matrix: number and size of enhancers and promoters before and after merging
nearby regulatory regions
}
\description{
This function accomplishes three tasks:
(1) Combines peaks from different sample types into one master list, and annotates
each peak with it's sample type-specificity (which cell or tissue types the peak can
be found in)
(2) Categorizes peaks as either a promoter or enhancer (promoter distance
is defined as 1500bp away from a transcription start site (TSS) by default, but the distance
can be changed with the distancefromTSS argument)
(3) Optionally, regulatory regions that are within a certain distance of each other
can be merged to form a larger regulatory region.
