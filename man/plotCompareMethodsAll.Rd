\title{Plots venn diagrams for comparison of two methods of identifying altered
regulatory regions Makes venn diagrams for TSS-proximal, TSS-distal, and combined
for both intensity-based peaks and for peaks identified by hotspot calling
algorithms.  There is no return value. Six venn diagrams will be plotted}
\usage{

\arguments{
\item{analysisresultsmatrix}{analysisresults of countanalysis function
place into a a analysisresults matrix by the analyzeanalysisresults function}

\item{viewer}{whether the plot should be displayed in the RStudio viewer or
in Shiny/Knittr}

\item{cols}{hex colors for points in this order: Experiment-Specific, Reference-Specific, Shared}
